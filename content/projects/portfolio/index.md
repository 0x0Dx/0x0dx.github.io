This is my personal portfolio project — a place where i will showcase my work and experiments.

I have build this project to share all my projects in one place.

### Features
- Showcases my projects with descriptions and images
- Clean, simple design for easy browsing
- Easy to update as I add new work

### Tech / Tools
- Built using [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)
- Using the [Blowfish](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish) theme
- Contents are written in markdown

This project is ongoing — I plan to add more work, include interactive demos, and make it fully mobile-friendly.
